Great minds think alike ;)\nI'll push my changes shortly.  I just completed a big re-write of roxygen over the weekend that adds a few new features to reduce documentation duplication.

Unfortunately it\ndoesn't have the best comit history but I assure you that the end code is\nclean. I would like to keep the history as it is because of the major input that Ian had in the development of these features. You can diff with master to have a better picture of what is going on.\nFirst it solves the issue #178 which has a long thread associated to it. In a\nnutshell the tz argument when date is in ISO-8601 format is not treated\nconsistently:\nymd_hms(\"2012-03-04T05:06:07Z\",  tz = \"America/Chicago\")\nDate in ISO8601 format; converted timezone from UTC to \"America/Chicago\".\n[1] \"2012-03-03 23:06:07 CST\"\n\nSee the last test case in test-parsers.R.\nSecond part builds on Ian's implementation of stamps for ISO-8601. See the\ntests. In a nutshell all of the following now work correctly:\nstamp_Ou <- stamp(\"2013-01-01T06:00:00Z\")\nstamp_Oo <- stamp(\"2013-01-01T00:00:00-06\")\nstamp_Oz <- stamp(\"2013-01-01T00:00:00-0600\")\nstamp_OO <- stamp(\"2013-01-01T00:00:00-06:00\")\n\nSee new test cases in tests-stamp.R.\nIn addition there are quite a number of aesthetic cleanups and new comments of\nthe code to assure that whenever I come back to my own code I recall fast what\nit was about."}, {"comment_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDY4MDE5", "comment_author": "vspinu", "comment_created_date": "2020-07-24T07:26:33Z", "comment_text": "typo: I ment to write that ISO8601 is now treated consistently, in the sense\nthat, when tz is present, ISO8601 time zone is respected and conversion is made\nto user specified tz with a warning."}, {"comment_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDkyMTI4", "comment_author": "garrettgman", "comment_created_date": "2020-07-24T15:16:39Z", "comment_text": "Thanks.
